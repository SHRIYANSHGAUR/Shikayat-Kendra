# Shikayat-Kendra
## A Full stack ( React - Java Spring Boot - MySql) application for Online Complaint Management
### The Frontend is made using REACTJS which consumes the RestApi using Axios library.
### The Backend is powered using SpringBoot which is a REST-API written in Java , SpringBoot uses JPA for Object Relational Mapping (ORM) which makes writing restapi calls easier as we dont have to write SQL queries on our own JPA does that for us.
### The Database that I have used is MySql database which is a relational Database best suited for this use case. 
### Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) is a Jakarta EE application programming interface specification that describes the management of relational data in enterprise Java applications.
### Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases. Put another way, you can see the ORM as the layer that connects object oriented programming (OOP) to relational databases
